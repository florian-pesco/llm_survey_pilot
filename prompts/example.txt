I will provide you with examples of survey questions and their actual median response times:

- Example 1:
    What is your marital status? Which of the following in the list applies to you?
    'Registered civil partnership' means that it is or has been a same-sex partnership within the meaning of the Act on Registered Life Partnerships (Lebenspartnerschaftsgesetz).

        3) Married and live separately from my spouse
        4) Single
